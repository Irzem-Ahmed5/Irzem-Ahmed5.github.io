            <figcaption>Camping in a tent is quite common</figcaption>

            <h3>Camping is an outdoor recreational activity of spending a certain amount of time
                (often a few days) living in a camp, tent or a camper.
            </h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Most campers will camp out in tents, these are contraptions made from different
                    materials, such as fiberglass and parachute fabric, to create temporary shelter
                </li>
                <li>Campers may also choose lodges or cabins, which are
                    sturdier shelters with more amneties than simple tents
                </li>
                <li>Travelling campers may choose to travel with their shelter!
                    These are in the form of RVs(recreational vehicles) that offer
                    portable shelter and convenience that a camper operates as a
                    vehicle
                </li>

            <h3>Winter Camping is one of the most favourite camping experiences for campers.
                This owes to the fact that during the winter, there are much less insects and
                there is something quite cozy about being bundled up next to a fire while sipping
                on a hot drink.
            </h3>
            <img src="images/pexels-dương-nhân.jpg" alt="A hammock camping set up in the trees">
            <h3>Spring, Summer and Fall are all game for camping. You may want to try different kind of camping
                in each whether though. Such as in the summer, due to abundance of different insects, hammock camping
                with nets would be quite preferable. This keeps you off the ground and away from
                potential night visitors and also from being swarmed by flying insects.

            <h3>Local national and state parks:</h3>
            <p>Local national and state parks in the USA are wonderful places to camp.
                They provide various types of campgrounds, from fully developed to primitive.
                The best part is you do not need to carry your things far and can bring extra stuff
                in your car. They usually have restrooms with running water. There is usually
                a fee to book the campsite.</p>

            <h3>Dispersed Camping:</h3>
            <p>allows you to camp on public land where it is allowed for free.
                This type of camping is more primitive and can prove dangerous for beginners.
                Adequate knowledge of public lands and its
                rules are must as well as survival knowledge and the proper tools.</p>

            <h3>RV Camping:</h3>
            <p>RV Camping is the use of a van/bus like vehicle to travel the roads and set camps
                in designated areas. They not only allow campers to visit far off places but campers can
                also visit more places. Most modern RVs are state of the art and afford
                campers many luxuries that include a bathroom, kitchen, full bed and more. You
                can go anywhere your wheels can take you!</p>

            <h3>Tents or Hammocks</h3>
            <img src="images/pexels-cottonbro-5993939-settingup-tent.jpg" alt="couple setting up tent">
            <figcaption>A two person tent set up</figcaption>
            <p>The most common way for people to get out in nature and camp is to take tents (or hammocks)
                with them. Most tents come with a parachute fabric waterproof material and fiberglass rods.
                This means that the tents are very light and can be carried over distances while hiking.
                Most tents set up within minutes. Also, different tents have different capacities, ranging
                from solo tents to tents that host over 8 people. Hammocks for camping are also an option,
                although not as common.
            </p>
            <h3>Rent a cabin with friends</h3>
            <img src="images/pexels-eneida-nieves-803975-cabin.jpg" alt="Brown cabin in woods in daytime">
            <figcaption>Cabins provide safer shelter with better amneties and a greater capacity</figcaption>
            <p>If being out in the wild with nothing but a few rods and a thin fabric as your only shelter
                from nature is not your cup of tea, you might want to consider renting a cabin. Cabins are
                shelters usually made from wood that provide excellent shelter while out in the wild. Depending
                on the type of cabin, they may even host more amneties, like electricity, fireplace, or even
                WiFi. Costs for renting cabins are usually split between friends who rent it together, making
                it more affordable.
            </p>
            <h3>Invest in an RV</h3>
            <img src="images/pexels-kampus-production.jpg" alt="A white and gray RV with chairs in front of it">
            <figcaption>RVs like this provide a home on wheels</figcaption>
            <p>If your goal is to travel to camp while travelling, RVs prove an excellent camping
                solution. RVs are like a tiny home on wheels, with some being equipped with a kitchen,
                bathroom, and even shower. An RV enables campers to a whole new realm of possibilities.
                One may travel far and wide and not worry about spending on hotels, motels, expensive meals
                at restaurants, or (ofcourse) transportation. However, one must be well prepared for their
                adventures in an RV, as at any point they could become their own mechanic, plumber or electrician.

            <figcaption>Exploring nature can behold majestic views</figcaption>
            <p>We are part on the nature that makes up our environment. Urbanization has led to a divide
                between us and nature, which has led to many people never having spent a night out in nature.
                Granted that camping may not be an attractive activity for some people, spending time in nature
                can feel good and therapuetic. We get to feel what our ancient ancestors may have felt out in
                nature.
            </p>
            <h3>Explore your own capabilities</h3>

                alt="Man in white shirt and black pants smiling and floating in flowing water">
            <figcaption>Sometimes nature puts you in discomfort and opens us up to new experiences</figcaption>
            <p>The path to learning new things can be frustrating and uncomfortable. Learning how to set up a tent,
                cook a meal on an open fire, withstand the elements of nature, can cause discomfort, however, can lead
                you to learning more about yourself. You can acheive things that you thought you could never do.
                Camping gives you a lot of time to do self reflection and exploring your capabilities.

            <p>Busy and stressful life schedules lead us to sometimes not spending enough time with
                our loved ones. When you are out camping, you are away from the daily life and have a lot of
                time from sunrise to sunset to unwind and do what you like. If you go camping with you loved ones, you
                can
                spend a lot of quality time with them.
