      I,
      <a href="irzemahmedintroduction.html"><u>Irzem Ahmed</u></a>, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract
      in my Fall 2022,
      ITIS3135, Web App Design and Development course with my instructor,
      Professor D.I. von Briesen.
    </p>

    <p class="contractparagraph">
      I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools
      will be available to the world, and will not put information there that
      is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
    </p>

    <p class="contractparagraph">
      I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not
      logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments
      may show as absences.
    </p>

    <p class="contractparagraph">
      I also understand that given the structure and content of this class
      it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’
      code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn,
      and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given
      credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
