        <ul>
            <li>The contrast of the page is good. All content on the page is easily readable and easy on the eyes</li>
            <li>The navigation panel is consistent and coherent</li>
            <li>The elements on the pages are beautifully aligned to the centerd</li>
            <li>The spacing and proximity between content is well established and consistent</li>
            <li>Overall this website is well designed. Some video buttons do not work right now (easy fix)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Peer review #2 - Evan Schlee</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>The contrast of emerald green background, orange nav panel and black text is good. Perhaps a different
                color text would be nice
                Buttons are given good 3d effects
            </li>
            <li>The learn/ teach page utilizes repitition in its design. It interacts similarly to other elements and
                feels right</li>
            <li>The elements on the pages are consistently aligned. I wish the nav was centered, but there is an option
                of adding more buttons</li>
            <li>Clear and thoughtful use of spacing and proximity</li>
            <li>Overall this website has a great design.</li>
        </ul>
