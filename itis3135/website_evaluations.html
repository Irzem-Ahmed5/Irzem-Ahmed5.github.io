        <h2>Website Evaluations based on CRAP design principles</h2>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale School of Art</a> (Overall: Poor design):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> This website makes a poor use of contrast.
                    There is an overuse of sharp contrast between different
                    artifacts on the website, which does not aid importance or relevance. Information is hard
                    to make out.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Repitition:</strong> There are no visual patterns in colors, in fact the website uses near
                    random
                    color pattern or gradients. This makes it hard to create relation between elements.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The left column is aligned but there are breaks within the column
                    followed by
                    a very long continous whitespace. Also, the rest of the page has many alignment breaks.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Most artifacts on this page have some sort of gapping, gutter or break.
                    Single elements seem to group together relevant information, however, the proximity of
                    elements with each other seems to lack connection. There is no discernable grouping.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://charlotte.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a> (Overall: Fair design):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> There is very little use of color, however, the blue links
                    are contrasted against the white background, hinting these are links to be clicked.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Repitition:</strong> This site is very predictable as all the links follow
                    the same color and fontt pattern. There is high predictability.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> This page has exceptional alignment. All the information
                    is neatly organized in easy to read columns and sections.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> All items are grouped into a section and column according
                    to category. This makes info easy to find and navigate.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-14-pro/">Apple</a> (Overall: Great design):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Apple.com uses a dark black background and the colors
                    of the products they showcase are bright and provide contrast that attracts attention.
                    There is minimal yet sharp use of contrast. It is easy on the eyes.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Repitition:</strong> Although apple uses a dynamic responsive page that requires
                    the user to scroll to view content, it is very predictable for the user. There is an overall
                    color scheme that the page sticks to.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The design is minimal and everything on the page is
                    aligned well.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> All items on the page are grouped together according
                    to relevance. This makes information easy to navigate and find.</li>
            </ul>
