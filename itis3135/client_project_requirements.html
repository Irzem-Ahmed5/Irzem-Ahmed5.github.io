        <h2>Client Project - Requirements and Design</h2>

        <h3>Project name: Quick Astronomy</h3>

        <h3>Project Overview: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The purpose of this website is to introduce users with
                little to no knowledge of Astronomy to learn more about
                this subject
            </li>
            <li>The users of this website will likely be beginner stargazing
                enthusiasts and also those just curious about the subject
            </li>
            <li>This site will host 5 distinct pages. There will be
                a separate page for different kinds of telescopes, dark
                sky maps, human history in Astronomy, and famous large-scale
                telescopes
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Client Information: </h3>

        <h3>Page Design</h3>
        <p> Below is a description of each of the five pages in this project</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Home:</strong> The purpose of this page is to serve as a landing page
                and provide a brief introduction to astronomy. The intended audience is someone
                who is new to the hobby of stargazing and astronomy in general. It will have
                text content and one or two images.
            </li><br>
            <li><strong>Telescopes: </strong>The purpose of this page is to
                introduce the user to different kinds of commercially available
                telescopes used for stargazing or sky observation. The audience here again is the
                beginner who does not know much difference between commercial telescopes. This page
                will host a table with descriptions and key differences.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Dark Sky Map: </strong>The purpose of this page is to familiarize
                the user with the dark sky by providing a map with popular constellations. The audience here
                is anyone who would like to identify constellations and popular sky objects. The dynamic element will
                live here, which will allow names to appear when you hover your mouse over the objects.</li><br>
            <li><strong>History: </strong>The purpose of this page is to give users a brief overview
                of astronomy throughout history. The audience is anyone who wants to know the history of
                astronomy. This will host a few sections talking about histrorical elements of astronomy.
            </li><br>
            <li><strong>Famous Large Telescopes: </strong>The purpose of this page is to serve as a introduction and
                tribute to
                the two famous telescopes: Hubble and JWST. The audience here is anyone who wishes to learn more about
                large telescopes that were used to capture historic pictures of the observable universe.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Dynamic Functionality: </h3>
        <p>The dynamic functionality I aim to implement in this
            project is to create the dark sky map. This will allow
            the user to hover their mouse over a picture of the night sky
            and be able to get information about key objects such as the north star.
            Here are two examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://stellarium-web.org/">
                    <u>Google sky</u>
                </a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://stellarium-web.org/"><u>Stellarium</u></a></li>
        </ul>
