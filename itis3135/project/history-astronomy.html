        <h2>History of Astronomy</h2>
        <section>

            <h3>Ancient times:</h3>
            <p>A long long time ago, Astronomy entailed the observation of sky objects only visible
                to the naked eye. This information was used for religious, ceremonial, or even
                agricultural purposes. Babylonian contributions came earlier and built the base of the subject. After
                them
                Greek astronomers spearheaded the most progess. <a

            </p>

            <h3>Astronomy through the middle ages</h3>
            <p>In the middles ages, astronomers in Islamic lands had mastered the Greek
                accomplishments and progressed it further. Arabic had become the language of
                learning astronomy, just as Greek was before it. After the revival of
                education in Europe, the leading language then became latin, which was translated first
                from Arabic translations of Greek works, until the European astronomers got direct access
                to those Greek works. Astronomy was also studied extensively in India and China. Thus, astronomy became
                a subject studied across different languages and
                cultures across the world. <a
